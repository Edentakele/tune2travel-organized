**Subject: Enhancing Emotion Detection Model: Focus on Disgust and Fear**

**Objective:** To improve the model's accuracy in distinguishing the emotions of "Disgust" and "Fear," with a specific focus on refining the decision boundary between "Disgust" and "Anger."

**Tasks & Strategies:**

**1. Refining "Disgust" Detection (Contrast with "Anger"):**
    *   **Generate contrastive examples** to help the model differentiate "Disgust" from "Anger."
        *   *Example:* "I'm furious" (Anger) vs. "That's disgusting" (Disgust).
    *   The goal is to provide clear examples that highlight the nuances of each emotion, thereby sharpening the model's decision boundary.

**2. Enhancing "Fear" Detection:**
    *   **Manual Data Labeling:**
        *   Manually label approximately 50 examples for "Fear."
    *   **Data Augmentation Techniques:**
        *   **Paraphrasing:** Generate variations of existing "Fear" examples.
            *   *Examples:* "I'm scared" → "That terrifies me"; "I’m anxious just watching this."
        *   **Back Translation:** Translate examples to another language and then back to the original to create diverse phrasing.
    *   **Synthetic Data Generation (Selin's Suggestion):**
        *   Utilize GPT-based methods to create additional synthetic training data for "Fear."

**Next Steps & Coordination:**

*   **Task Distribution:** Please coordinate with Eden to divide the tasks outlined above.
*   **Progress Update:** We aim to have made significant progress on these tasks by Wednesday.
*   **Repository:** Please ensure the repository work is completed, and share the link by Wednesday.
